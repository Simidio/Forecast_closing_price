Here's an example of how to use the Facebook Prophet library to analyze and forecast financial data, such as the closing price of a specific stock in the stock market.
explanation of how Prophet works, the time series forecasting library developed by Facebook.

# Prophet steps:
* Data Decomposition: The first step in Prophet is decomposing the data into three main components: trend, seasonality, and residual component. The trend represents the overall direction in which the data is moving over time. Seasonality captures the recurring or periodic patterns in the data, such as daily, weekly, or yearly variations. The residual component represents the errors or random variations that cannot be explained by the trend or seasonality.

* Additive or Multiplicative Model: Prophet can work with both additive and multiplicative models. In the additive model, the components (trend, seasonality, and residuals) are combined by simply adding them together. In the multiplicative model, the components are multiplied together. The choice between additive and multiplicative models depends on the nature of the data and the relationship between the components.

* Trend Estimation: Prophet employs a piecewise linear model to estimate the trend. It divides the time series into small intervals and fits a linear model to each interval, allowing the trend to change direction over time. This approach captures both linear and non-linear trends in the data.

* Seasonality Estimation: Prophet uses Fourier series to model the seasonality component. It decomposes the periodic patterns into a sum of sinusoidal components with different frequencies and amplitudes. This allows Prophet to capture various seasonal patterns present in the data.

* Handling Holidays and Special Events: Prophet provides the ability to incorporate information about holidays or special events that can impact the time series. It allows users to define custom holiday dates and provide their effects on the forecast. This feature enables the model to account for the impact of holidays on the data.

* Automatic Outlier Detection: Prophet automatically detects and handles outliers in the time series data. Outliers are treated as temporary deviations from the underlying trend and are not allowed to overly influence the forecast. Prophet uses a robust method to identify outliers and includes them in the modeling process without distorting the overall predictions.

* Uncertainty Estimation: Prophet provides uncertainty intervals for the forecasted values. It generates both the point forecast and the upper and lower bounds of the prediction intervals. This allows users to assess the uncertainty associated with the forecasts and make informed decisions based on the range of possible outcomes.
